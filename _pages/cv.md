* ***2020 Apr - 2020 Jul*: DeepLearning Method in Pattern Generation**
  * ZhiShang (Shanghai) Technology
  * Using PG-GAN, DC-GAN to generate patterns with artists styles, 
    training keypoint detection networks, deploying services includes 
    super-resolution, image style transfer, border extraction.

* ***2018 Sep - 2019 Jul*: DeepLearning Method in 3D Medical Image Segmentation**
  * SIST, ShanghaiTech University
  * Designed a new framework to consider the 3d information, it provided extra embedded information in the 
    decoding module. I also considered an axis-aligned trident network. 
  * Email to [me](mailto:maoym.tony@gmail.com) for more information.
  * Supervisor: [Associate Professor Xuming He](https://xmhe.bitbucket.io/).


* ***2019 Jul - 2019 Aug*: Dynamic Font Effect Transfer**
    * AI Lab, Bytedance Inc.
    * Implemented font effect transfer algorithm individually. 
To transfer one natural dynamic effect by computing 
the nearest neighbour field of reference dynamic image
and target generated image. This work saved time for
our graphics designer and enriched our dynamic effects 
font library.
    * Supervisor: [Mr. Yuning Jiang](https://yuningjiang.github.io/)

* ***2019 Aug - 2020 Mar, 2020 Jul - Present*: Video Effect Rendering**
    * AI Lab, Bytedance Inc.
    * Developed video effects, transition effects, green-screen effects, artificial intelligence effects rendering framework, based on OpenGL, accelerated by GPU. In the process of software upgrades, I learned to deal with exceptions, avoid server stress, optimize frameworks by four revisions, and object-oriented programming. The construction of the video effects rendering framework has enabled the company's advertising business traffic to increase significantly, providing interfaces for computer vision technology access.
    * Supervisor: [Dr. Ke Li](mailto:like.niklaus@bytedance.com)
